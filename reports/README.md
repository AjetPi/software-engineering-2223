Here are a few topics about prossible reports:
 * Writing high performance code in a script language (like python). If you choose python then your report should probably contain topics like numpy, cython, pypy, numba.
 * Writing secure software in a language like C/C++.
 * Floating point numbers - representation and IEEE754, operations, infinities, nans, positive and negative zero, subnormal values.
 * Data driven development (that one is more difficult).
 * Tooling (like static code analysis) in your favorinte programming langauge (not python as these will be covered in the course).
 * RAII in C++ - advantages and disadvatages.
 * Software engineering in the aerospace industry.
 * Softskills in software engineering.

If you have your own idea please discuss it first with your teather.

Reports are optional but giving a reports will count toward the final mark.

Two students can give two separate reports on the same topic.

A report can be given by a group of students. In that case the entire group will be evaluated. The report need to be proportional in length and/or depth to the number of people in the group.
